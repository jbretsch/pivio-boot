# Getting started.

Just run ./pivio.sh

You need to have docker, java and docker-compose for now.

And point your browser to your docker machine on port 8080.

To get a demo running do:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pivio/pivio-boot/master/demo.sh | /bin/sh
```

You can get an empty Pivio running with

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pivio/pivio-boot/master/pivio.sh | /bin/sh
```
